  "faq.a3": "An MCP App is an interactive extension that renders a visual UI right inside your AI conversation. Unlike regular MCP tools that only return text, MCP Apps can show rich content — like ChartPane's interactive charts. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the open standard that makes this possible.",

  "faq.q6": "Do I need to know how to code?",
  "faq.a6": "No. Describe what you want in plain English and ChartPane handles the rest. If you're already asking Claude to analyze data, you already know how to use ChartPane."
