  "charts_line.best_5": "Start the Y-axis at zero unless the range of variation is the story",
  "charts_area.p_what_1": "An area chart is a line chart with the region below the line filled in. The filled area emphasizes the volume or magnitude of values over time, not just the trend. Stacked area charts show how multiple series add up to a total.",
  "charts_area.p_what_2": "Area charts work best when you want to communicate magnitude alongside direction. The visual weight of the filled region makes it immediately clear which values are large versus small. They are especially powerful when comparing a few series that do not overlap much.",

  "charts_doughnut.p_what_1": "A doughnut chart is a pie chart with a hole in the center. Like a pie chart, each arc represents a proportion of the whole. The center cutout reduces the emphasis on area comparison and creates space for a label, total value, or icon.",
  "charts_doughnut.p_what_2": "Doughnut charts have become the preferred alternative to pie charts in modern dashboards.

  "charts_doughnut.best_1": "Same rules as pie charts: 6 or fewer slices, order by size",
  "charts_doughnut.best_2": "Use the center space for a total, percentage, or descriptive label",
  "charts_doughnut.best_3": "Keep the cutout ratio consistent across a dashboard (typically 50-70%)",
  "charts_doughnut.best_4": "Avoid nesting more than 2 rings; it becomes hard to read",
  "charts_doughnut.best_5": "Add percentage labels on or near each arc segment",
  "charts_scatter.p_what_1": "A scatter plot (also called an XY chart) places individual data points on a two-dimensional grid where each axis represents a different variable. Each point shows the intersection of two measurements for a single observation. The resulting pattern reveals whether and how the two variables are related.",
  "charts_scatter.p_what_2": "Scatter plots are the primary tool for exploring relationships between variables. A tight diagonal cluster suggests strong correlation. A random spread suggests none. Outliers stand out visually, and natural groupings often emerge without any statistical analysis.",

  "charts_radar.p_what_1": "A radar chart (also called a spider chart or web chart) displays multivariate data on a two-dimensional plot with three or more axes radiating from a center point. Each axis represents a different variable, and data points are plotted along these axes and connected to form a polygon. The shape of the polygon reveals the profile of the data.",
  "charts_radar.p_what_2": "Radar charts are uniquely good at showing strengths and weaknesses across multiple dimensions simultaneously. Overlaying two or more polygons makes it easy to compare profiles. A perfectly balanced entity forms a regular polygon, while imbalances create distinctive shapes that are immediately recognizable.",

  "charts_radar.when_4": "Performance reviews and capability assessments",
  "charts_radar.when_5": "Competitive analysis across multiple criteria",
  "charts_radar.best_1": "Use 5-8 axes; fewer than 5 is better as a bar chart, more than 8 becomes unreadable",
  "charts_radar.best_2": "Ensure all axes use the same scale (e.g., 0-100)",
  "charts_radar.best_3": "Limit to 2-3 overlapping polygons for clarity",
  "charts_radar.best_4": "Use semi-transparent fills so overlapping areas are visible",
  "charts_radar.best_5": "Order axes logically; place related variables adjacent to each other",
  "charts_radar.best_6": "Add gridlines so readers can estimate values without hovering",
  "charts_stacked.p_what_1": "A stacked chart places multiple data series on top of each other within the same bar or area. Each segment shows one component, and the total height or area represents the sum. This lets you see both the overall total and the individual contributions in a single view.",
  "charts_stacked.p_what_2": "Stacking works with both bar charts and area charts. Stacked bar charts are more common for comparing category totals, while stacked area charts are used to show how composition changes over time. A 100% stacked variant normalizes everything to percentages, making it easy to compare proportions even when totals differ.",
  "charts_stacked.when_1": "Showing how parts contribute to a total (revenue by channel, budget by department)",
  "charts_stacked.when_2": "Comparing totals across categories while seeing the breakdown",
  "charts_stacked.when_3": "Tracking how composition changes over time (traffic sources by month)",
  "charts_stacked.when_4": "When the total matters as much as individual components",
  "charts_stacked.when_5": "Using 100% stacked to compare proportions when absolute values vary widely",
  "charts_stacked.best_1": "Limit to 3-5 stacked segments; more becomes hard to read",
  "charts_stacked.best_2": "Put the most important or largest segment at the bottom",
  "charts_stacked.best_3": "Use consistent colors across time periods for the same category",
  "charts_stacked.best_4": "Add data labels or tooltips so exact values are accessible",
  "charts_stacked.best_5": "Consider a grouped bar chart instead if comparing individual segment values is more important than totals",
  "charts_stacked.best_6": "Use 100% stacked when the story is about proportion, not absolute values",
